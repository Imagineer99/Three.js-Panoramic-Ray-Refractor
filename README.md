# Three.js-Ray-Refractor
The law of reflection, also known as the angle of reflection, is a fundamental principle in optics and physics that describes how light or other electromagnetic waves behave when they encounter a reflecting surface.

This is a simple WebGL demo using Three.js that demonstrates refraction effects using the WaterRefractionShader. It creates a scene with a refractive object that interacts with the environment to create a magnifying glass-like effect.
